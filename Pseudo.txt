1. Set Start char and index

2. Find last char == start char from end

3. Check if specified indeces match
	
	if match, continue until at middle		
		
		if we made it all the way, check substring length to the current longest palindrome and maybe replace
			then set new start to end + 1

	else, move start index to next char and end to end of string and try again
